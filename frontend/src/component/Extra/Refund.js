Refund Policy - No Return Policy <br /><br />

At fashionboi, we value our customers and strive to provide the best products and services. We understand that sometimes you may have concerns or issues with your purchase. This Refund Policy explains our guidelines for refunds in situations where we do not have a return policy.
 <br /><br />
1) No Return Policy <br /><br />
Please note that fashionboi does not have a return policy for products that are not damaged or defective. Once a product is purchased, it is considered final sale and cannot be returned for a refund or exchange unless it meets the criteria outlined in Section 2.
 <br /><br />
2) Refunds for Damaged or Defective Products <br /><br />
2.1 Notification of Damage or Defect
 <br /><br />
If you receive a damaged or defective product, please contact our customer support within 3 days of receiving the item. You can reach us via contact page on website, providing details about the issue and attaching relevant photographs or evidence, if applicable.
 <br /><br />
2.2 Return Authorization (if applicable)
 <br /><br />
In some cases, we may require you to return the damaged or defective product. Our customer support team will guide you through the return process, including providing you with a return authorization number and instructions for shipping the item back to us.
 <br /><br />
2.3 Evaluation and Resolution
 <br /><br />
Upon receiving the damaged or defective product, we will thoroughly inspect it to verify the issue. This evaluation process may take [1-2] business days. If the product is found to be damaged or defective due to manufacturing defects or shipping mishandling, we will initiate the refund process as described in Section 3.
<br />
<br />
3) Refund Process <br /><br />

 <br /><br />
For eligible damaged or defective products, we offer the following refund options: <br /><br />

a) Full Refund: We will issue a full refund, including the original purchase price and any applicable shipping charges, to the original payment method used for the purchase.
 <br /><br />
b) Replacement: If you prefer, we can replace the damaged or defective product with an identical item. The replacement will be shipped to you at no additional cost.
 <br /><br />
3.2 Refund Processing Time
 <br /><br />
Once the refund has been approved, we will process it as quickly as possible. The time it takes for the refund to appear in your account may vary depending on your payment provider's policies. Typically, refunds are processed within [1-3] business days.
